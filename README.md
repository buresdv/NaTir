# NaTir

This was supposed to be a much-improved iOS app for Slovenske železnice. The official one is so useless and abhorrent to use, I decided to make my own.

Unfortunately, Slovenske železnice shut down the API I was using, so I had to shut down the development of this app.

## What improvements did this app have over the official app?

1. Coded natively for iOS in SwiftUI, instead of whatever the official app is supposed to be coded in.Whatever it is, it makes the back gesture not work
2. Inline delays for each train. No more looking for your train in a long-ass list on a completely separate page
3. Adding paper tickets
4. Live updates for delays and trains
5. Much more convenient displays of trains. Seriously, the official app doesn't even show you where each train is supposed to terminate! how are you supposed to know which train to get on?! Anyway, you could also see every single stop for any train
6. Favoriting of trains and routes
7. Calculating transfer times
8. Showing what services each train offers
9. And much more

## Using the source code

Unfortunately, I can't let you use this source code or these designs in your own projects without consulting me first. If you're from SŽ and want to partner up, I'm all ears.
